- Price touches/breaks below lower Bollinger Band
- RSI indicates oversold conditions (‚â§30)
- Price below Simple Moving Average
- Volume exceeds 20% of average
- Recent downward momentum present

**Sell Signals Triggered When:**
- Price touches/breaks above upper Bollinger Band  
- RSI indicates overbought conditions (‚â•70)
- Price above Simple Moving Average
- Volume exceeds 20% of average
- Recent upward momentum present

### Position Sizing
